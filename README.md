# Back_end_CA4


Here is my last back-end rendering.
For this one I had to create a todo-list application, using flask.
In my application, I implemented the CRUD, which allows the user to modify his list, or to delete an item. Moreover, my application includes an authentication system; the user has the choice to log in, register in the site, or log out.
Unfortunately, this is all my application has, even if I was able to implement some tests, both positive and negative.
